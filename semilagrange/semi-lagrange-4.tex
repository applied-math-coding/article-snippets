To solve the system
\begin{align*}
	&v'(t)=F(t,x(t),v(t))\\
	&x'(t)=v(t)\\
	&x(0)=x_0\\
	&v(0)=v_0
\end{align*}
we use the Euler scheme to discretize in time. We could choose a more accurate scheme, but for showing the main idea it suffices. For each grid-point $x_A$ we ask from where the volume arriving here has departed. This volume must exists since it solves the backward-in-time equivalent to above system. Formally this reads
\begin{equation} \label{v_step}
\tilde{v}(t^{k+1}, x_A)=\tilde{v}(t^k, x_D)+\Delta t\cdot F(t^k, x_D, \tilde{v}(t^k, x_D))
\end{equation}
Note, by using $\tilde{v}(t,x)$ we make explicit that this is the approximate velocity of the volume currently located at $x$.
Since we don't know $x_D$, equation (\ref{v_step}) cannot be used alone in each step.
The idea is to discretize $x'(t)=v(t)$ as a part of above system and to solve
\begin{equation}
	x_A=x_D+\Delta t\cdot v(t^k, x_D)
\end{equation} 
for $x_D$.
This is done by iterating the equation
$$
x_D=x_A-\Delta t\cdot v(t^k, x_D)
$$
which may be started with $x_D^0:=x_A$.
For $\Delta t$ being sufficiently small, the r.h.s is a contracting map and so Banach's fix-point theorem ensures a unique solution.
After having found $x_D$, we would like to use it in (\ref{v_step}) in order to approximate the velocity at $x_A$. But since $x_D$ is certainly not matching a grid-point we have to interpolate $\tilde{v}(t^k, x_D)$ as well as $F(t^k, x_D, \tilde{v}(t^k, x_D)$ from known values.
