	Products play an important role in applications of category theory. Its definition is like always leaned at the 
	corresponding construct from set theory.
\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Product}\\
	In a category $C$ the product of two objects $A_1, A_2$ is an object
	denoted by $A_1\times A_2$ together with two morphisms
	$$p_1:A_1\times A_2\rightarrow A_1$$
	and
	$$p_2:A_1\times A_2\rightarrow A_2$$
	such that the following holds:\\
	For any object $X$ and morphisms $f_1:X\rightarrow A_1$ and $f_2:X\rightarrow A_2$ there exists a unique morphism denoted by $\langle f_1,f_2\rangle:X\rightarrow A_1\times A_2$ such that
	$$
	p_1\circ\langle f_1,f_2\rangle=f_1
	$$
	and
	$$
	p_2\circ\langle f_1,f_2\rangle=f_2
	$$
\end{definition}
The morphisms $p_1, p_2$ are called projections and $\langle f_1, f_2\rangle$ the product morphism of $f_1, f_2$. This shall remind to the product in set theory. One easily verifies that the set theoretic product of two sets fulfills all requirements of this categorical version.\\
The notation of a product entails that the product itself only depends on the factors. It turns out that this is correct up to isomorphism.

\begin{theorem} \label{product_isomorphy}
	The product $A_1\times A_2$ of two objects $A_1, A_2$ is unique up to isomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let us assume there exists two objects $P$ and $Q$ and corresponding morphisms $p_1, p_2$ and $q_1, q_2$ such that both fulfill the requirements to be the product of $A_1$ and $A_2$. We show, there exists an isomorphism $j:P\rightarrow Q$. We apply the product properties of $P$ onto the case $X=P$, $f_1=p_1$ and $f_2=p_2$. Then by assumption there is a unique morphism $i:P\rightarrow P$ such that $p_1\circ i = p_1$ and $p_2\circ i = p_2$. We conclude 
	\begin{equation} \label{i_equal_id_P}
	i=id_P
    \end{equation}
    We repeat this application but for the case $X=Q$, $f_1=q_1$ and $f_2=q_2$. This yields a unique morphism 
    $$\langle q_1,q_2 \rangle:Q\rightarrow P$$
    In analogy, by using the product properties of $Q$, we find from the case $X=P$, $f_1=p_1$ and $f_2=p_2$, the existence of 
    $$\langle p_1,p_2 \rangle:P\rightarrow Q$$
    We show that $\langle q_1,q_2 \rangle$ and $\langle p_1,p_2 \rangle$ yields the desired isomorphism and its inverse. Using the properties of product morphism one gets:
    $$
    p_1\circ \langle q_1,q_2 \rangle \circ \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle = q_1\circ  \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle=p_1
    $$
    and
    $$
    p_2\circ \langle q_1,q_2 \rangle \circ \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle = q_2\circ  \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle=p_2
    $$
    Comparing this with the above morphism $i$ and its uniqueness, (\ref{i_equal_id_P}) implies
    $$
    \langle q_1,q_2 \rangle \circ \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle=id_P
    $$
    By analogous steps or just symmetry, one finds
    $$
    \langle p_1,p_2 \rangle \circ  \langle q_1,q_2 \rangle=id_P
    $$
    which yields the desired result.	 
\end{proof}
The next theorem shows that the product is associative in case all factors do exist in $C$.

\begin{theorem}
	If $A_1, A_2, A_3$ are objects from a category $C$, then
	$$(A_1\times A_2)\times A_3=A_1\times (A_2\times A_3)$$
	under the condition that all factors are defined.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The proof is similar to the one of theorem \ref{product_isomorphy}. By using
	several projections one yields a unique morphism $f:(A_1\times A_2)\times A_3\rightarrow A_1\times (A_2\times A_3)$ and another $g:A_1\times (A_2\times A_3)\rightarrow  (A_1\times A_2)\times A_3$. The like in proof of the above theorem, one compares the projections of $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ with the projections of $id:(A_1\times A_2)\times A_3\rightarrow (A_1\times A_2)\times A_3$ resp. $id:A_1\times (A_2\times A_3)\rightarrow A_1\times (A_2\times A_3)$.
\end{proof}
This last theorem gives sense to products of arbitrary finite factors. Moreover, if a category contains the product of any two objects, it also contains all finite products.
